    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I grew up in the town of Wayne, NJ where I lived with my parents and a younger sister. 
        I fell in love with coding in my freshman year of high school and I pride myself on my ability
        to complete projects quickly and copetently as well as my ability to solve problems and learn new things. 
        I really enjoyed the aspect of just trying my hand at totally new concepts and being able to see
        my progress in real time. Plus I personally have a preference for my work being something I've worked hard to create. As far as who 
        I am as a person, I have a plethora of different interests such as Hapkido karate, working out, electric guitar, camping, 
        biking, building computers, and video games. For anyone who is interested in more specific details about these 
        interests I am a black belt, my favorite work out day is chest day, I like to do camping and biking in the same trip, 
        I've built 9 computers, and my favorite game of all time is The Last of Us. I'm also definitely a bit of a collector. I 
        like to collect models of things from movies or video games (guns from different games, light sabers, etc...), lego sets that
        model something cool from the real world, and watches. Though I have to admit my watch collecting is more in the begging 
        stages. It also probably goes without saying but I also love to spend time with my friends and family. Activity's
        with friends or family are always fun but honestly I tend to enjoy just sitting down and chatting the most. That all 
        just about sums me up.
