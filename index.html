    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I grew up in Wayne, NJ, where I lived with my parents and younger sister. I currently live in Rochester, NY, 
        working on my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I fell in love with coding in my first year of high school.  
        I love the challenge of finding creative solutions and the feeling of accomplishment when I succeed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy many interests in my free time, such as Hapkido martial arts, personal fitness, playing electric guitar, camping, biking, 
        building computers, and video gaming. I am a black belt in Hapkido, my favorite workout day is chest day, and I prefer weekend 
        trips where I can combine biking and camping. I started building computers in 8th grade and have built a total of 9. My all-time 
        favorite video game is, The Last of Us, with League of Legends coming in at a close second.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm also a collector. I collect replicas of objects from movies and video games (i.e., light sabers, guns.) LEGO® sets that model 
        something cool from the real world, like my first Fender® guitar, a Nintendo™ Entertainment System, or an old Ford Mustang. I'm also in the 
        beginning stages of building a watch collection, with my prized piece being an Omega Speedmaster '57 with a burgundy dial.
    </p>
    <p>
        I love spending time with my friends and family. Activities with friends or family are always fun; however, I enjoy sitting down and chatting the most.
